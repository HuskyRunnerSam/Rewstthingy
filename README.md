# Rewstthingy
I created this script to get local weather data and return local weather in either F or C.
I used the .openweathermap.org API to retrieve the data
I also added a check for invalid zip codes to reprompt the user to enter a valid zip code.

to run the code localy make sure you first install the request repository using 
<< pip install requests >> 
Also make sure you have python install locally. Go to https://www.python.org/ for more details.
